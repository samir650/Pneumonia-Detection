# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Introduction
Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lungs affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli. Symptoms typically include cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. The severity varies, and the condition is often diagnosed using chest X-rays, blood tests, and sputum cultures.

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify chest X-ray images as either normal or pneumonia-affected using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of chest X-ray images categorized into two classes:
- ✅ **Normal:** X-ray images of healthy individuals
- ❌ **Pneumonia:** X-ray images showing pneumonia infection

The dataset is preprocessed using image augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.

## 🔧 Dependencies and Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn keras tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## 🏗 Model Architecture
