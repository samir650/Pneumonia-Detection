# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

## Introduction
Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lungs affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli. Symptoms typically include cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. The severity varies, and the condition is often diagnosed using chest X-rays, blood tests, and sputum cultures.

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify chest X-ray images as either normal or pneumonia-affected using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Dataset
The dataset consists of chest X-ray images categorized into two classes:
- **Normal:** X-ray images of healthy individuals
- **Pneumonia:** X-ray images showing pneumonia infection

The dataset is preprocessed using image augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.

## Dependencies and Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn keras tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## Model Architecture
The deep learning model used is a CNN built using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend. The architecture consists of:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- Max-pooling layers
- Batch normalization
- Fully connected dense layers
- Dropout for regularization

## Training Process
The model is trained using:
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy and loss

The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets. Image augmentation is applied to improve performance.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Usage
To run the model, execute the Jupyter Notebook file:
```bash
jupyter notebook pneumonia_detection.ipynb
```
Ensure the dataset is correctly placed in the directory specified in the notebook.

## Results and Visualization
The notebook includes:
- Model training and validation accuracy plots
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Sample predictions with actual vs. predicted labels

## Contributors and Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by medical imaging research and Kaggle datasets. Contributions from deep learning enthusiasts and healthcare professionals helped refine the model.
